# Project-Interactive-Audio-Interface

Switching of the song NAME/Title and song may or may not play/show up recoded everything in Codepen and added Jquery to make it work. I didn't know how to external, so i did it in codepen with the help of Jquery (https://codepen.io/jayson-to-cool-frimpong/pen/gOwWvEj)
(Had issues making it appear)

(Using Javascript was a hard project but I got use to it at the end, hoping you could send an email if you see anything wrong or areas of improvement. I wanted to do way more but I didn't know what to do in the beginning and when i found out it was to late by then but otherwise Merry Christmas, Happy New Year)
